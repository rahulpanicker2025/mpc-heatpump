Residential buildings have a significant impact on global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to space and water heating demands. To mitigate this, the adoption of multi-functional heat pumps (MFHPs) has emerged as a key strategy for reducing residential energy consumption.   Time-varying   electricity   prices   incentivize homeowners to shift their energy usage from peak to off-peak periods, promoting a balance in electricity supply and demand. This shift not only reduces energy costs but also contributes to lower building emissions by utilizing renewable energy sources during off-peak hours. Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) is an effective approach for automated load shifting, utilizing dynamic system models to predict behavior and optimize control actions based on economic cost functions. In the context of residential building energy systems, EMPC integrates time-varying electricity prices to determine control strategies that minimize electricity consumption costs. The results of this study demonstrate the superiority of EMPC over rule-based   (RB)   controllers,   with   a   significant   28.87% improvement in electricity consumption costs.
